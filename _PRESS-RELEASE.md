There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Chill & Netflix

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  For those who won't decide.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  How many hours have we wasted deciding what to watch on Netflix instead of watching content on Netflix? With so many options at our disposal, it can be hard to choose. Chill & Netflix makes the choice for you. This product allows you to filter content you hate, but handles all the rest of the decision-making process, allowing you to chill and watch Netflix. More time on content. Less time wasted.
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  How can I use my time watching Netflix in the most efficient way possible. Increased options means increased complexity, which can lead to decision-making brain freeze. Before you know it, you have run out of time to watch anything.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Randomness. Allow the experience to be curated for you. If you use this service, it means you're tired of wasting time deciding. You are ready to watch. By randomizing the results, and restricting choices, you'll be given a recommendation from Netflix's library, and then the choice complexity is broken down to a binary yes or no choice.
## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  You could be watching something, and instead you're thinking of what to watch.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
simply sign up, or if you already have an account log in, and click "Show me what you got!", and a random title from Netflix is generated. If you've seen the title before AND you really can't stand it, click the unwatchable button, and that title will be filtered from your results in the future. Otherwise get watching.
## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  With Chill & Netflix, I've been able to watch twice as much content on Netflix.
## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
